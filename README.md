This Phoenix application mimics a Human Resources (HR) system and Store Management System (SMS). The HR system has a database of employees with pubsub functionality - meaning any changes made to one instance of the database is immediately updated to other instances. The HR system also produces a JSON of the employees database to be consumed by the SMS. The SMS requires user authentication to access any webpage. As well, the SMS has databases of stores and products with a belongs-to/has-many relationship where one store has many products.
